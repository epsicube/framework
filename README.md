Epsicube Framework provides a clean architecture for structuring applications around independent modules and shared packages. 

It is designed to improve maintainability, scalability, and reusability by encouraging strict separation of concerns.

For full documentation, please consult **[https://epsicube.dev](https://epsicube.dev)**.

## Features

* **Modular architecture** — Encapsulated business logic (routes, controllers, migrations, views) inside self‑contained modules.
* **Shared packages** — Cross‑cutting features organized in dedicated packages.
* **Development ergonomics** — Project tooling, hooks, testing setup, and consistent structure.
* **Extensibility** — Clear service provider structure and integration mechanisms.
