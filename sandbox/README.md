## About Epsicube

Epsicube is a high-performance modular framework built on top of Laravel. It is designed to transform the way developers build large-scale applications by enforcing a **strictly decoupled architecture** and providing a powerful modular ecosystem.

We believe that enterprise-grade development should be agile, organized, and, above all, modular. Epsicube enhances the Laravel experience by adding:

- **Strict Modular Architecture**: Organize your logic into independent, reusable [modules](https://epsicube.dev/writing-module/).
- **Unified Administration**: A built-in [administration panel](https://epsicube.dev/built-in/administration/) to manage your entire system.
- **Dynamic Options API**: Define, store, and [manage configurations](https://epsicube.dev/usage/manage-options/) without touching a single line of code.
- **Smart Schemas**: [Define](https://epsicube.dev/schemas/defining-schemas/) and [export](https://epsicube.dev/schemas/export-schemas/) data structures across your ecosystem.
- **Advanced Lifecycle**: Master your application with custom [activation drivers](https://epsicube.dev/advanced/activation-driver/) and [lifecycle management](https://epsicube.dev/advanced/lifecycle/).

Epsicube remains 100% compatible with the Laravel ecosystem while providing the structural discipline required for robust, long-term projects.
